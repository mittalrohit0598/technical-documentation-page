                <header>What is HTML?</header>
                <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a> (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element">elements</a>, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tag">tags</a> can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
                <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a>) element:</p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;p&gt;</code>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Tags in HTML are case-insensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title"><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></a> tag could be written as <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;TiTlE&gt;</code>, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency, readability, and other reasons.</p>

                <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
                <p>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:</p>
                <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9347/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="Anatomy of an HTML tag">
                <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>

            <section id="Nesting_elements" class="main-section">
                <header>Nesting elements</header>
                <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong"><code>&lt;strong&gt;</strong></code></a> element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:</p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                <p>There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element first, then opened the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element. For proper nesting, we should close the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element first, before closing the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</p>
                <p>The following is an example of the wrong way to do nesting:</p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
            </section>
            <section id="Block_versus_inline_elements" class="main-section">
                <header>Block versus inline elements</header>
                <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the documentâ€™s content. (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content) An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text. For example, as an &lt;a&gt; element (hyperlink) or emphasis elements such as &lt;em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> HTML5 redefined the element categories: see <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#element-content-categories">Element content categories</a>. While these definitions are more accurate and less ambiguous than their predecessors, the new definitions are a lot more complicated to understand than <em>block</em> and <em>inline</em>. This article will stay with these two terms.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> The terms <em>block</em> and <em>inline</em>, as used in this article, should not be confused with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Box_model#Types_of_CSS_boxes">the types of CSS boxes</a> that have the same names. While the names correlate by default, changing the CSS display type doesn't change the category of the element, and doesn't affect which elements it can contain and which elements it can be contained in. One reason HTML5 dropped these terms was to prevent this rather common confusion.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Find useful reference pages that include lists of block and inline elements. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements">Block-level elements</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements">Inline elements</a>.</p>

            <section id="Empty_elements" class="main-section">
                <header>Empty elements</header>
                <p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. For example, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a> element embeds an image file onto a page:</p>
                <code>&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"&gt;</code>
                <p>This would output the following:</p>
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="Mozilla Firefox logo">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Empty elements are sometimes called <em>void</em> elements.</p>

            <section id="Attributes" class="main-section">
                <header>Attributes</header>
                <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
                <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9345/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="An HTMLt tag showcasing attributes">
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
                <p>An attribute should have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <section id="Boolean_attributes" class="main-section">
                <header>Boolean attributes</header>
                <p>Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable. These are called Boolean attributes. Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name. For example, consider the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-disabled"><code>disabled</code></a> attribute, which you can assign to form input elements. (You use this to disable the form input elements so the user can't make entries. The disabled elements typically have a grayed-out appearance.) For example:</p>
                <code>&lt;input type="text" disabled="disabled"&gt;</code>
                <p>As shorthand, it is acceptable to write this as follows:</p>
                <code>
                    &lt;!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box --&gt;
                    &lt;input type="text" disabled&gt;
                    
                    &lt;!-- text input is allowed, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute --&gt;
                    &lt;input type="text">&gt;
                </code>
            </section>
            <section id="Omitting_quotes_around_attribute_values" class="main-section">
                <header>Omitting quotes around attribute values</header>
                <p>If you look at code for a lot of other sites, you might come across a number of strange markup styles, including attribute values without quotes. This is permitted in certain circumstances, but it can also break your markup in other circumstances. For example, if we revisit our link example from earlier, we could write a basic version with only the <code>href</code> attribute, like this:</p>
                <code>&lt;a href=https://www.mozilla.org/&gt;favorite website&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                <p>However, as soon as we add the <code>title</code> attribute in this way, there are problems:</p>
                <code>&lt;a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage&gt;favorite website&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                <p>As written above, the browser misinterprets the markup, mistaking the <code>title</code> attribute for three attributes:  a <code>title</code> attribute with the value <em>The</em>, and two Boolean attributes, <code>Mozilla</code> and <code>homepage</code>. Obviously, this is not intended! It will cause errors or unexpected behavior, as you can see in the live example below. Try hovering over the link to view the title text!</p>
                <p>Always include the attribute quotes. It avoids such problems, and results in more readable code.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Single_or_double_quotes?" class="main-section">
                <header>Single or double quotes?</header>
                <p>In this article you will also notice that the attributes are wrapped in double quotes. However, you might see single quotes in some HTML code. This is a matter of style. You can feel free to choose which one you prefer. Both of these lines are equivalent:</p>
                <code>
                    &lt;a href="http://www.example.com"&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;

                    &lt;a href='http://www.example.com'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;
                </code>
                <p>Make sure you don't mix single quotes and double quotes. This example (below) shows a kind of mixing quotes that will go wrong:</p>
                <code>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;;</code>
                <p>However, if you use one type of quote, you can include the other type of quote <em>inside</em> your attribute values:</p>
                <code>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com" title="Isn't this fun?"&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                <p>To use quote marks inside other quote marks of the same type (single quote or double quote), use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#Entity_references_Including_special_characters_in_HTML">HTML entities</a>. For example, this will break:</p>
                <code>&lt;a href='http://www.example.com' title='Isn't this fun?'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;</code>

                <p>Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:</p>
                <code>
                    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                        &lt;html&gt;
                            &lt;head&gt;
                                &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
                                &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;
                            &lt;/head&gt;
                            &lt;body&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;This is my page&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;/body&gt;
                        &lt;/html&gt;
                </code>
                <p>Here we have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. Doctypes used to look something like this:</p>
                        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;</code>
                        <p>More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right. <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>: The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html"><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></a> element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>: The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head"><code>&lt;head&gt;</code></cod></a> element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, <strong>that isn't the content</strong> the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You'll learn more about this in the next article of the series.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code>: This element specifies the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.</p>
